FRIEND RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

ABSTRACT

In modern social networks, users often find it challenging to identify potential friends from a massive collection of existing users. The main objective of our Friend Recommendation System is to provide personalized friend suggestions that fit the userâ€™s social preferences and interests. By analyzing mutual friendships and common interests, the system predicts which users are most likely to form meaningful connections.

More than 60 percent of social network users face difficulty in discovering new friends with shared hobbies or similar social circles. By developing this recommendation system, users can save time searching for potential friends, and the system ensures that suggested connections are relevant and meaningful. The recommendation score for each user is calculated based on mutual friends and shared interests, providing a quantitative measure of compatibility.

The system is implemented in C language using structured data types and an adjacency matrix to represent the social network graph. Users can view all registered members, add new users along with their interests, and receive friend recommendations in real time. The recommendation logic highlights both the number of mutual friends and the overlap of interests, ensuring that users are suggested friends who are socially and personally compatible. This system demonstrates the effective application of basic graph theory, array manipulation, and algorithmic analysis in enhancing social network connectivity.
